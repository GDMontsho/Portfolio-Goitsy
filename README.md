## How the project was made:

I started with a simple wireframe I sketched on excalidraw. This truly helped me visualise the project and 'put my ideas on paper' before starting to implement the code. Structure is important to my workflow so I made sure to have as much in place before writing the code.

On this day I worked mainy with the HTML structure. It is important to me that there is a uniformity to the website so I went ahead and chose a color theme. These are the colors I chose for my theme: For the main font I chose this pink. ` #ff00db` and for the main color theme I chose: `#0e131f` this bluish black. I like how the colors played off each other.

Let the coding begin! On this day I focused on implementing the layout that I previously planned.(see wireframe files) I also started thinking about responsitivity from the beginning of my project because I know how detrimental it can be to only implement it at the end. I started with a desktop version but mainly focusing on layout because that can influence the responsitivity. I opted to use media queries to solve my fear of a non responsive website. I also worked on the basic HTML and CSS structure.

I also worked on my favorite feature on the contact page (flying orbs). Using CSS variables (something I am self-studying). I managed to code a feature that is pleasing to look at.

I worked on implementing uniformity to my website and making sure that elements are symmetrical and true to my layout and project goals. I also experimented with animation as it was important to add elements of dimension to the project using HTML and CSS only.

I realised that I spent time on the aesthetics and not the structure. I deleted all my code simply because I found it hard to scale the desktop version into mobile version. :cold_sweat:
I focused on the lessons from flexbox and CSS grid in order take control of the structure and the fluidity of my elements.
I rebuilt the basic HTML and CSS focusing on structure and fluidity but using the same style and aesthetics from my first attempt.

My building started taking a direction I really liked. I worked more intuitively after reviewing tons of documentation on layout and responsiveness. I finally had control of the elements on my page and could manipulate them.:trophy:

:rocket: The project took off over the weekend and investing time on tydying up my code and aligning elements to the page for an intuitive user experience. I took this time to also review the feedback I received from classmates and implement some fixes.

I worked on improving the version I have by testing media queries on different viewports. <br>
<b>Bonus: </b> I will give myself bonus points for publishing to github. :wink:
