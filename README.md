# Portfolio-Goitsy

## This is a HTML&CSS portfolio project for a web development student.

### Description:

###### Welcome to my project , fellow developer. This is where you fill find my project titled 'Portfolio-Goitsy. A web dev project that uses HTML and CSS to make a responsive website

## How the project was made:

### <u> 02 May 2024 </u>

#### I started with a simple wireframe I sketched on excalidraw. This truly helped me visualise the project and 'put my ideas on paper' before starting to implement the code. Structure is important to my workflow so I made sure to have as much in place before writing the code.

#### On this day I worked mainy with the HTML structure. It is important to me that there is a uniformity to the website so I wen ahead and chose a color theme. These are the colors I chose for my theme: For the main font I chose this pink. ` #ff00db` and for the main color theme I chose: `#0e131f`. I like how the colors played off each other.

#### Let the coding begin! On this day I focused on implementing the layout that I had previously planned. I also started thinking about responsitivity from the beginning of my project because I know how detrimental it can be to only implement it at the end. I started with a 'mobile first approach' but mainly focusing on layout because that can influence the responsitivity. I opted to use media queries to solve my fear of a non responsive website. I also worked on the basic HTML and CSS structure.

#### I also worked on my favorite feature on the contact page (flying orbs). Using CSS variables (something I am self-studying). I managed to code a feature that is pleasing to look at.

#### I worked on implementing uniformity to my website and making sure that elements are symmetrical and true to my layout and project goals. I also experimented with animation as it was important to add elemnts of dimension to the project using HTML and CSS only.
